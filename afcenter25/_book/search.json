    "text": "Statement from the Chairman of the Board of Directors\nDear Stakeholders,\nAs we reflect on the past year, I am both proud and inspired by the resilience and dedication of our organization in promoting good governance and sustainable development in the legal sector. Our mission to promote transparency, accountability, and the rule of law has never been more critical, and I am honoured to present this annual report, which highlights our achievements, challenges, and the path forward.\nHowever, the challenges we face are significant. The global landscape of democratic governance is evolving, and we must remain vigilant and adaptable. In response, we have fortified our commitment to advocacy and legal support for those who stand against corruption.\nLooking ahead, we are excited to embark on new initiatives that will further our impact. We will continue to invest in research and data-driven advocacy, ensuring that our strategies are informed by evidence and best practices. Additionally, we are committed to enhancing our capacity-building programs, as well as equipping individuals and organizations with the tools they need to combat corruption effectively.\nI would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to our partners, dedicated staff, board members, volunteers, and supporters. Your unwavering commitment and passion for our goals are the driving forces behind our success. Additionally, we would like to welcome our new advisory board members. Together, we are making a difference and will continue to strive for a world where integrity prevails.\nAs we move forward, let us remain united in our mission. Fighting impunity, money laundering, and financial and organized crimes is not just a challenge; it is an opportunity to build a more just and equitable society for all. Thank you for your continued support and belief in our vision.\nSincerely,\n\nJideani Agabaidu\n\nChairman of the Board\nAfrican Center for Governance, Asset Recovery and Sustainable Development\n\n\n\nSetting The Course For 2025 - A Year In Review\nJuliet Ibekaku-Nwagwu Founder/Executive Director\nAs 2024 ends, we reflect on a year of significant achievements and persistent challenges in our fight against illicit financial flows (IFFs) and their impact on governance and sustainable development across Africa. At the African Center, we remain steadfast in our commitment to promoting transparency, accountability, and good governance, guided by the principles of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), particularly Goal 16, on Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions. We are also guided by the African Union 2063 Agenda, the Common Africa Position on Asset Recovery and the Global Framework on Asset Recovery.\nThis past year has underscored the urgent need for our work. It is well documented that corruption, IFFs, and money laundering erode public trust, divert crucial resources from development priorities, and exacerbate inequalities. The intricate web of illicit financial flows, often facilitated by complex transnational networks, deprives nations of vital funds needed to invest in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, hindering progress toward the SDGs.\nThis report details our key activities and accomplishments over the past year in response to this threat. In this annual report - our first - you will read about our impactful research, advocacy efforts, capacity-building programs, and strategic partnerships. We are proud of our progress in contributing to the efforts to remove Nigeria from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) greylist through collaboration with the Nigeria Legal Professionals. This collaboration led to the drafting of the anti-money laundering risk assessment for the legal sector in Nigeria, the development of an anti-money laundering reporting portal, the drafting of guidance on the role of civil society in asset recovery, the drafting of an asset recovery policy manual for the Federal Ministry of Justice.\nFinally, this collaboration enabled us to supportAfrican institutions and non-state actors to address weak governance structures. These successes are a testament to the dedication and expertise of our team, the unwavering support of our partners, and the resilience of the communities we serve.\nSignificant obstacles remain, including the complexity of cross-border investigations, limited political will, and lack of resources. To overcome these challenges, we must continue to innovate, collaborate, and strengthen our collective efforts. Looking ahead, we are committed to deepening our impact by leveraging technology through our open assets database, expanding our reach to new regions, and strengthening collaboration with government agencies. We will continue to champion the principles of transparency and accountability, working tirelessly to ensure that proceeds of criminal activities are recovered and returned to their rightful owners. We invite you to explore this report and learn more about our work. We are deeply grateful to our partners, particularly the MacArthur Foundation, the Foreign and the Commonwealth Development Office (UK FCDO) and German GIZ. Your support is essential to the sustenance of our mission. Our progress over the past months would not have been possible without the dedication of our board and staff. I am genuinely grateful for your time and expertise in advancing the African Center’s mission.\nTogether, we can build a future where the principles of justice, the rule of law, good governance and sustainable development prevail.I look forward to continuing our collective efforts in the years ahead.\nSincerely,\nJuliet Ibekaku-Nwagwu\nFounder & Executive Director\nAfrican Center for Governance Asset Recovery and Sustainable Development",

The Center works with national governments, international and regional organizations, and non-governmental organizations to promote good governance, sustainable development, and the rule of law. We work to foster national and international cooperation in the recovery and return of proceeds of corruption and illicit financial flow to fill funding gaps for implementing the SDGs.

We aim to promote good governance, sustainable development, and the rule of law. This is achieved through training, research, program management, strategy development, international cooperation, and promoting anti-corruption and anti-money laundering regulatory compliance.\nSince 2022, the African Center has advanced governance, asset recovery transparency, and justice sector accountability. Partnering with global and regional organizations, we have trained legal and financial professionals across Africa in asset tracing and financial crime management.\nOur work focuses on anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, counter-financing of terrorism and countering proliferation financing(AML/CFT/CPF). Collaborating with the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) and Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit, we enhance compliance through research, risk assessment, and policy guidance. Our Executive Director serves on key NBA committees to strengthen legal sector compliance.\nWe support Nigerian agencies in addressing FATF grey list deficiencies through training and international cooperation efforts with the Global South Dialogue on Economic Crime (GSDEC). To sustain research and training, we have agreements with institutions like Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies (NIALS),Digital Evidence Forensics and Compliance Institute( DEFCI), and the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA).\nOur research covers illicit financial flows, justice reforms, and asset recovery, aligning with Agenda 2063. We have published a compendium on anti-corruption best practices and are working with Nigeria’s Ministry of Justice on UN anti-corruption initiatives. Our Open Asset Database maps African asset recovery data.\nWe partner with UNODC, the World Bank, and the UNCAC Coalition to shape an African-centric asset recovery approach. In collaboration with IBLF Global, we are developing a CSO Advocacy Toolkit under Transparency International’s REAP project and advising the African Development Bank on asset management.",

    "text": "Thematic Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe African Center has three thematic objectives.\n\n\n\nStrengthening Governance and Accountability for Sustainable Development\nAt the African Center, we are committed to advancing good governance and accountability across Africa by aligning our efforts with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our approach goes beyond policy advocacy. We drive real change by ensuring citizens, especially women, have access to quality education, justice, and economic empowerment tools.\nThis year, we focused on breaking systemic barriers that hinder inclusive development. Through targeted initiatives, we challenged harmful social norms, expanded economic opportunities, and leveraged technology to address the unique needs of women. By working at the intersection of governance, gender equity, and innovation, we are building stronger,\n\n\nRecovery and Return of Stolen Assets\nUnder the Asset Recovery theme, the African Center works with national, regional, and international organizations and professional bodies in the private and public sectors to develop clear and comprehensive legal frameworks for recovering the proceeds of all forms of crime and transparently managing the returned assets for the benefit of the victims of these crimes. Our efforts align with Chapter V of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combatting Corruption (AUCPCC), and the Common African Position on Asset Recovery (CAPAR). The Center’s core objectives are to identify the links between the return of proceeds of crime and sustainable development and to work with countries of the global South to advocate for expedited mechanisms to return stolen assets for the benefit of their citizens.\n\n\nImplementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals\nAt the African Center for Governance and Asset Recovery, we are at the forefront of strengthening asset recovery systems to ensure that stolen wealth is returned and used for the benefit of socio-economic growth. The Center works with development partners and other civil society organizations to ensure the effective implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN/SDGs) and the African Union (AU) Agenda 2063. We focus specifically on UN SDG Goal 16 and AU Agenda Goals 11 and 12. Our aim is to “promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels”. The African Center’s work in this thematic area is closely linked to the governance and asset recovery thematic areas.

    "text": "In 2023 and 2024, the African Center advanced its mission through capacity building, stakeholder engagement, and policy advocacy. Key initiatives included training investigative journalists on asset recovery and FATF methodologies, collaborating with global institutions to combat financial crime, and launching guidelines for civil society organizations on managing proceeds of crime. Through high-level engagements, risk assessment workshops, and international partnerships, the Center reinforced its commitment to transparency, accountability, and strengthening Nigeria’s financial integrity.\n\n1.0.1 Speaker: Nigerian Bar Association, Bwari Branch\nThe African Center for Governance, Asset Recovery, and Sustainable Development joined the Law Reform Committee of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Bwari Branch as a panelist in the one-day symposium on Anti-Corruption on December 8, 2023.\nThe symposium, themed “Anti-Corruption Fight in Nigeria: A Lost Battle or a Work in Progress?” aligns with the global efforts to address the issue of pervasive corruption and to mark International Anti-Corruption Day on December 9, 2023.\nIt provided a platform for stakeholders to deliberate on the state of Nigeria’s anti-corruption initiatives and chart a course for future progress. Perspectives and insights on the challenges and successes encountered in Nigeria’s ongoing battle against corruption was shared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0.2 Training: Counter Financing of Terrorism Specialists at the International Institute for Justice and Rule of Law\nOn 21-23rd November 2023, the African Center facilitated three sessions at the National Training on Countering the Financing of Terrorism organized by The International Institute for Justice and Rule of Law (IIJ) in Abuja, Nigeria.\n \nThe three-day national-level training program was aimed at building the capacities of investigators, prosecutors, judges, financial analysts, and regulatory authorities and promoting inter-agency cooperation and public-private dialogue. It sought to equip key CFT actors in Nigeria with comprehensive knowledge and practical strategies to counter the financing of terrorism within the country effectively. Additionally, the training was aimed to align the national CFT framework with FATF requirements with expected outcomes, including an enhanced understanding of Nigeria’s specific terrorist financing vulnerabilities and tools to address them; improved knowledge of tools and techniques for identifying, tracking, and disrupting terrorist financing networks, in particular involving high-risk sectors; and improved interagency cooperation and public-private dialogue on CFT. Vulnerabilities within the nation’s high-risk sector of Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs), Non-Profits, and Virtual Assets were also addressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n1.0.3 Facilitation: Webinar with the Compliance Institute of Nigeria\nOn 5 July 2023, the Compliance Institute of Nigeria (CIN) in collaboration with the African Center for Governance, held a webinar titled “Recent Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Regulatory and Legal Frameworks in Nigeria: How to Use a Risk-Based Approach to Onboard Customer”.\nThree hundred and forty participants attended the webinar including law enforcement agencies, bankers, compliance officers, and compliance enthusiasts. Key issues on the recent AML/CFT legal frameworks and risk-based approach were discussed by speakers from the Special Control Unit on Money Laundering (SCUML), the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU), and the African Center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0.4 Facilitation: Session with the Global South Dialogue on Economic Crime\nIn February 2024, the African Center facilitated a session at the GSDEC workshop, “A Multistakeholder Approach to Nigeria’s FATF Delisting”. The event brought together stakeholders to discuss challenges and strategies for Nigeria’s removal from the grey list.\nThe session highlighted the critical role of leadership in promoting good governance and combating financial crimes. Drawing from past experience in corruption investigations and Nigeria’s 2013 delisting, the discussion reinforced the African Center’s commitment to transparency, accountability, and economic crime prevention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0.5 Publication: Compendium on Lessons Learned from Anti-Corruption Efforts in Past Administrations\nJanuary 2024\nA Compendium on Lessons Learned from Anti-Corruption Efforts in Past Administrations (2015-2023) was published to bridge critical knowledge gaps in Nigeria’s governance landscape. This resource documents best practices, challenges, and strategic insights from nearly a decade of anti-corruption initiatives.\nProviding evidence-based recommendations, the Compendium equips policymakers, practitioners, civil society organizations, and citizens with tools to strengthen future anti-corruption efforts. By outlining a roadmap for reform and practical solutions to governance challenges, it reinforces the commitment to transparency, accountability, and institutional integrity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0.6 Facilitation: Webinar on the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism Principles\nThe African Center co-hosted a webinar with the NBA Anti-Corruption Committee on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism: Balancing Confidentiality and Compliance. Moderated by Ezenwa Anumnu, the session examined the new Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC) for Legal Practitioners in line with FATF standards.\nSpeakers, including Dr. Roland Otaru, SAN, and Prof. Ernest Ojukwu, SAN, emphasized ethics, Know Your Customer (KYC), record-keeping, and risk-based reporting. The lead speaker, Juliet Ibekaku-Nwagwu, highlighted key RPC amendments, legal obligations, and the NBA Anti-Money Laundering Committee’s role in compliance.\nWith 400 participants, the webinar reinforced the African Center’s commitment to transparency, accountability, and strengthening Nigeria’s efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0.7 Stakeholder Engagement: Review and Implementation Of The ICRG Action Plan\nJune 2024\nIn partnership with GSDEC, we convened key stakeholders to accelerate Nigeria’s removal from the FATF grey list. With support from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), the session focused on urgent actions and collective responsibility in achieving this goal.\nSenior officials from NFIU, EFCC, NDLEA, and FMOJ outlined Nigeria’s progress since its 2023 greylisting, highlighting strengthened laws, enhanced money laundering prosecutions, and improved international cooperation.\nReaffirming their commitment, stakeholders pledged to drive strategic reforms, enhance asset recovery efforts, and bolster AML/CFT enforcement, ensuring Nigeria’s swift and lasting compliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0.8 Training: Nigerian Investigative Journalists Workshop in Collaboration with RUSI, UK\nIn partnership with RUSI, we hosted a webinar Demystifying FATF to equip investigative journalists with the tools to combat corruption. The session provided a deep dive into FATF’s processes, its role in promoting financial integrity, and how journalists can leverage this knowledge in their work.\nDiscussions also explored Nigeria’s recent Mutual Evaluation Report (MER), highlighting the implications of the country’s greylisting. By empowering investigative journalists with critical expertise, the African Center reinforces its commitment to fostering transparency, accountability, and a stronger financial system in Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0.9 Participation: International Anti-Corruption Conference\nThe African Center for Governance reaffirmed its commitment to combating corruption by actively participating in the International Anti-Corruption Conference (IACC) 2024.

The session featured key stakeholders, including representatives from ANEEJ, EFCC, and the Kano Anti-Corruption Commission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0.11 Participation: UNCAC Implementation Review Group\nSeptember 2024\nThe first part of the resumed Fifteenth Session assessed the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption, focusing on Chapters II (Preventive Measures) and III (Criminalization and Law Enforcement). Established under Resolution 3/1, the Implementation Review Group serves as an open-ended intergovernmental body, overseeing the review process, identifying challenges and best practices, and addressing technical assistance needs to enhance the Convention’s effectiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0.12 Launch: Guidelines for Civil Society Organizations on Managing and Monitoring Proceeds of Crime in Nigeria\nIn partnership with CLEEN Foundation, we presented the Guidelines for Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) on Monitoring and Managing Proceeds of Crime, emphasizing CSO involvement in asset recovery. Key stakeholders from the Federal Ministry of Justice, ICPC, NBA, and over sixty CSOs discussed legal frameworks like UNCAC, AUCPCC, and Nigeria’s Proceeds of Crime Act (2022), highlighting CSOs’ role in promoting accountability.\nParticipants called for stronger legal provisions to empower citizens in asset recovery. The African Center and CLEEN Foundation were recognized for fostering collaboration between state and non-state actors to enhance transparency and sustainable development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0.13 Facilitation: African Development Bank 2024 Anti-Corruption Seminar\nThe 2024 Anti-Corruption Seminar, themed “Profit from Integrity: Capitalizing on Anti-Corruption Measures in Africa,” brought together esteemed experts to tackle corruption in Africa. The seminar emphasized the significance of asset recovery in deterring criminals, restoring justice, and promoting sustainable development.\nEmphasizing the need for diplomatic engagement and collective action, speakers noted that asset recovery extends beyond legal measures. The session called for a review of the Common African Position on Asset Recovery (CAPAR) and the AUCPCC to assess progress toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the African Union’s Agenda 2063.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0.14 Facilitation: Event on Combating Illicit Financial Flows in Africa’s Extractive Sector at the UNTOC Conference of Parties\nThe African Center hosted a panel on Countering Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs) in the Extractive Industry during the 12th UNTOC Conference of Parties. Moderated by Brook Horowitz, CEO of IBLF Global, the discussion examined strategies to curb IFFs and drive sustainable development in Africa.\nExperts highlighted Nigeria’s extractive sector as a major contributor to Africa’s IFFs, citing discretionary licensing as a key driver. The session emphasized strengthening asset recovery, enforcing anti-money laundering standards, adopting UN COSP Resolution 10/23 on Beneficial Ownership, and sanctioning financial secrecy jurisdictions to combat illicit flows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0.15 Facilitation: Risk Assessment Workshops across Nigeria\nIn collaboration with the NBA, the NBA Anti-Money Laundering Committee (NBA-AMLC) we held the AML/CFT Legal Sector Risk Assessment Workshops in Lagos, Abuja, Yola, Port Harcourt, Kano, and Enugu to strengthen lawyers’ ability to combat financial crime through a risk based assessment of possible ML/FT/PF risks. The workshop assessed ML/FT/PF risks through online questionnaires and in-person sessions from October 28 to 31.\nEngaging 375 legal professionals, key stakeholders, and regulators, the workshop fostered dialogue on risk assessment and compliance. At the Abuja session on December 31, 2024, NBA President Mazi Afam Osigwe SAN emphasized balancing client confidentiality with preventing legal services misuse for illicit activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0.16 Facilitation: Validation and Joint Action Planning Meeting for the NBA-AMLC\nThe African Center collaborated with the NBA Anti-Money Laundering Committee (NBA-AMLC) in a strategic session to address money laundering and illicit financial flows.

A key highlight was the unveiling of the AML/CFT Legal Sector Risk Assessment Report, reinforcing the NBA’s commitment to strengthening Nigeria’s legal framework and aligning with global anti-financial crime standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0.18 Publication: Risk Assessment Report for the Legal Sector in Nigeria\nNigeria’s mutual evaluation reports and recent case studies have demonstrated the vulnerabilities of legal professionals to ML/TF/PF. In response, the Nigerian Bar Association Anti-Money Laundering Committee (NBA-AMLC) conducted a risk assessment survey. The scope of the survey was to gain a strong understanding of the AML/CFT/PF vulnerabilities that legal professionals perceive themselves to be exposed to, evaluate the level of knowledge, awareness, and training that lawyers have in relation to AML/CFT/PF compliance. The Risk Assessment Report represents a significant step towards enhancing the legal sector’s compliance with Nigeria’s Anti-Money Laundering, Counter-Terrorist Financing, and Proliferation Financing (AML/CFT/PF) obligations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0.19 Publication: Policy Brief on the Nigerian Legal Sector Risk Assessment\nDecember 2024\nIn line with the Risk Assessment Report, a policy brief was published by the African Center.

The report identifies critical challenges, including Ethical Dilemmas: balancing client confidentiality with AML obligations; compliance gaps: inadequate frameworks, especially in smaller firms; resource disparities: uneven access to compliance tools.\nTo strengthen the sector, the brief recommends mandatory Training: Regular AML/CFT/CPF education, enhanced supervision: stronger enforcement of compliance and policy reviews: and ongoing updates to stay ahead of risks. This brief aims to position Nigeria’s legal sector as a global model of integrity and compliance, reinforcing its role in fighting financial crimes.\n\n\n1.0.20 Development: CSO Toolkit on Fighting Illicit Financial Flows in Africa\nThe African Center worked on the research and development of a toolkit in collaboration with the Culture of Business, UK. The project supported the regional advocacy work undertaken as part of the Rallying Efforts to Accelerate Progress (REAP) project for Transparency International, which aimed to curb inequalities in Africa by addressing its root causes, such as illicit financial flows(IFF), inadequate access to public resources by vulnerable groups, and limited social accountability. The toolkit was drafted for Transparency International Berlin and provided a simplified advocacy instrument for CSOs to combat IFF in Africa.\n\n\n1.0.21 Development: Guidelines for the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Justice to Improve International Cooperation\nThe African Center was part of a project that is being implemented by the GSDEC, the Nigeria Institute of Advanced Legal Studies (NIALS). The project aims to support the Asset Recovery and Management Unit (ARMU), the Central Authority Unit (CAU) in the Federal Ministry of Justice (FMOJ), and other relevant officials to achieve the target set by IO.2 of the ICRG Action Plan. The core objectives that were identified during a one-day workshop organized by GSDEC in collaboration with the NFIU and the African Center included to: support the FMOJ in the drafting of an International Cooperation Policy, training and mentoring 32 relevant officials, including law enforcement agencies, anti-corruption agencies, who are generally referred to as liaison officers to achieve its IO.2 requirements.

We are also guided by the African Union 2063 Agenda, the Common Africa Position on Asset Recovery and the Global Framework on Asset Recovery.\nThis past year has underscored the urgent need for our work.

Our approach goes beyond policy advocacy. We drive real change by ensuring citizens, especially women, have access to quality education, justice, and economic empowerment tools.\nThis year, we focused on breaking systemic barriers that hinder inclusive development. Through targeted initiatives, we challenged harmful social norms, expanded economic opportunities, and leveraged technology to address the unique needs of women. By working at the intersection of governance, gender equity, and innovation, we are building stronger,\n\n\nRecovery and Return of Stolen Assets\nUnder the Asset Recovery theme, the African Center works with national, regional, and international organizations and professional bodies in the private and public sectors to develop clear and comprehensive legal frameworks for recovering the proceeds of all forms of crime and transparently managing the returned assets for the benefit of the victims of these crimes. Our efforts align with Chapter V of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combatting Corruption (AUCPCC), and the Common African Position on Asset Recovery (CAPAR). The Center’s core objectives are to identify the links between the return of proceeds of crime and sustainable development and to work with countries of the global South to advocate for expedited mechanisms to return stolen assets for the benefit of their citizens.\n\n\nImplementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals\nAt the African Center for Governance and Asset Recovery, we are at the forefront of strengthening asset recovery systems to ensure that stolen wealth is returned and used for the benefit of socio-economic growth. The Center works with development partners and other civil society organizations to ensure the effective implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN/SDGs) and the African Union (AU) Agenda 2063. We focus specifically on UN SDG Goal 16 and AU Agenda Goals 11 and 12. Our aim is to “promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels”.
