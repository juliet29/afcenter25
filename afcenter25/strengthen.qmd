### Training: Counter Financing of Terrorism Specialists at the International Institute for Justice and Rule of Law 
On 21-23rd November 2023, the African Center facilitated three sessions at the National Training on Countering the Financing of Terrorism organized by The International Institute for Justice and Rule of Law (IIJ) in Abuja, Nigeria.  
   
The three-day national-level training program was aimed at building the capacities of investigators, prosecutors, judges, financial analysts, and regulatory authorities and promoting inter-agency cooperation and public-private dialogue. It sought to equip key CFT actors in Nigeria with comprehensive knowledge and practical strategies to counter the financing of terrorism within the country effectively. Additionally, the training was aimed to align the national CFT framework with FATF requirements with expected outcomes, including an enhanced understanding of Nigeria’s specific terrorist financing vulnerabilities and tools to address them; improved knowledge of tools and techniques for identifying, tracking, and disrupting terrorist financing networks, in particular involving high-risk sectors; and improved interagency cooperation and public-private dialogue on CFT. Vulnerabilities within the nation’s high-risk sector of Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs), Non-Profits, and Virtual Assets were also addressed.

### Publication: Risk Assessment Report for the Legal Sector in Nigeria

Nigeria’s mutual evaluation reports and recent case studies have demonstrated the vulnerabilities of legal professionals to ML/TF/PF. In response, the Nigerian Bar Association Anti-Money Laundering Committee (NBA-AMLC) conducted a risk assessment survey. The scope of the survey was to gain a strong understanding of the AML/CFT/PF vulnerabilities that legal professionals perceive themselves to be exposed to, evaluate the level of knowledge, awareness, and training that lawyers have in relation to AML/CFT/PF compliance. The [Risk Assessment Report](https://africancenterdev.org/nba-legal-sector-risk-assessment-report-2024) represents a significant step towards enhancing the legal sector’s compliance with Nigeria’s Anti-Money Laundering, Counter-Terrorist Financing, and Proliferation Financing (AML/CFT/PF) obligations.

To strengthen the sector, the brief recommends mandatory Training: Regular AML/CFT/CPF education, enhanced supervision: stronger enforcement of compliance and policy reviews: and ongoing updates to stay ahead of risks. This brief aims to position Nigeria’s legal sector as a global model of integrity and compliance, reinforcing its role in fighting financial crimes.   
    
### Development: CSO Toolkit on Fighting Illicit Financial Flows in Africa

The project supported the regional advocacy work undertaken as part of the Rallying Efforts to Accelerate Progress (REAP) project for Transparency International, which aimed to curb inequalities in Africa by addressing its root causes, such as illicit financial flows(IFF), inadequate access to public resources by vulnerable groups, and limited social accountability. The toolkit was drafted for Transparency International Berlin and provided a simplified advocacy instrument for CSOs to combat IFF in Africa.

### Development: Guidelines for the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Justice to Improve International Cooperation 

The African Center was part of a project that is being implemented by the GSDEC, the Nigeria Institute of Advanced Legal Studies (NIALS). The project aims to support the Asset Recovery and Management Unit (ARMU), the Central Authority Unit (CAU) in the Federal Ministry of Justice (FMOJ), and other relevant officials to achieve the target set by IO.2 of the ICRG Action Plan. The core objectives that were identified during a one-day workshop organized by GSDEC in collaboration with the NFIU and the African Center included to: support the FMOJ in the drafting of an International Cooperation Policy, training and mentoring 32 relevant officials, including law enforcement agencies, anti-corruption agencies, who are generally referred to as liaison officers to achieve its IO.2 requirements. Key to its core areas, the African Center provided an in depth case analysis of sentencing on AML/CFT and Proceeds of Crime cases to guide the drafting of the sentencing guidelines.
