# Statement from the Chairman of the Board of Directors {.unnumbered}

Dear Stakeholders,

As we reflect on the past year, I am both proud and inspired by the resilience and dedication of our organization in promoting good governance and sustainable development in the legal sector. Our mission to promote transparency, accountability, and the rule of law has never been more critical, and I am honoured to present this annual report, which highlights our achievements, challenges, and the path forward.

However, the challenges we face are significant. The global landscape of democratic governance is evolving, and we must remain vigilant and adaptable. In response, we have fortified our commitment to advocacy and legal support for those who stand against corruption.

Looking ahead, we are excited to embark on new initiatives that will further our impact. We will continue to invest in research and data-driven advocacy, ensuring that our strategies are informed by evidence and best practices. Additionally, we are committed to enhancing our capacity-building programs, as well as  equipping individuals and organizations with the tools they need to combat corruption effectively.

I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to our partners, dedicated staff, board members, volunteers, and supporters. Your unwavering commitment and passion for our goals are the driving forces behind our success. Additionally, we would like to welcome our new advisory board members. Together, we are making a difference and will continue to strive for a world where integrity prevails.

As we move forward, let us remain united in our mission. Fighting impunity, money laundering, and financial and organized crimes is not just a challenge; it is an opportunity to build a more just and equitable society for all. Thank you for your continued support and belief in our vision.

Sincerely,\

**Jideani Agabaidu**\
